# Weed Detection using Faster R-CNN

This project implements a **Weed Detection System** using **Faster R-CNN**, a state-of-the-art object detection model. The goal of this project is to identify and classify various types of weeds from images of crops, enabling automatic weed control for agricultural applications.

## Project Overview

This project uses the **Faster R-CNN** model to detect weeds from images of crops. We train the model on a custom dataset of images labeled with weed and crop annotations, and evaluate its performance using metrics like **IoU (Intersection over Union)**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **Average Precision**. 

### Key Features:
- Uses **PyTorch** and **Torchvision** for building and training the Faster R-CNN model.
- Includes preprocessing steps like image resizing, augmentation, and edge detection for better feature extraction.
- Implements evaluation metrics such as **IoU**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **Average Precision**.
- Provides a simple pipeline for training and evaluating the model.

Dataset
Dataset Overview:
This project uses a custom dataset of crop and weed images, where each image is annotated with bounding boxes for the objects of interest. The dataset consists of images of crops and different types of weeds. Annotations are in JSON format, which contain bounding box coordinates and class labels.

Ensure the dataset directory structure is as follows:

markdown
Copy code
dataset/
    images/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    annotations/
        image1.json
        image2.json
        ...
Dataset Format:
Images: Stored in the images/ directory in .jpg or .png format.

Annotations: Stored in the annotations/ directory as .json files. Each JSON file contains information about the bounding boxes and class labels in the corresponding image.

Example annotation format:

json
Copy code
{
    "image": "image1.jpg",
    "regions": [
        {
            "shape_attributes": {"name": "rect", "x": 100, "y": 120, "width": 150, "height": 200},
            "region_attributes": {"class": "weed"}
        }
    ]
}
Model Architecture
The model used in this project is Faster R-CNN with a ResNet-50 backbone. Faster R-CNN is an object detection model that uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to generate object proposals and then classifies and refines them using a RoI (Region of Interest) pooling layer.

Backbone: Pre-trained ResNet-50 from ImageNet.

Anchor Generator: Custom anchor sizes and aspect ratios tailored for weed detection.

Box Predictor: Replaces the default box predictor with one suited for our dataset.

Training the Model
To train the model, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset according to the directory structure above.

Run the training script:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --epochs 10 --batch-size 8 --lr 0.005
Parameters:

--epochs: Number of epochs to train the model.

--batch-size: Size of the batch for each training step.

--lr: Learning rate for the optimizer.

Training Process:
The model will train for the specified number of epochs and output loss values for classification loss, bounding box regression loss, and RPN box regression loss during each epoch.

The loss values and progress are displayed via a progress bar from the tqdm library.

Evaluation
After training, you can evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the test/validation set:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py
This script will compute the following metrics:

IoU (Intersection over Union)

Precision

Recall

Average Precision (AP)

Mean Average Precision (mAP)

The results are printed at the end of the evaluation.

Metrics
IoU (Intersection over Union)
Measures the overlap between predicted bounding boxes and ground truth bounding boxes.

Higher IoU indicates better object localization.

Precision
The proportion of true positive detections among all predicted positive detections.

Recall
The proportion of true positive detections among all actual positive objects (ground truth).

Average Precision (AP)
Measures the precision at various recall levels. It summarizes the performance of the model across different IoU thresholds.

Mean Average Precision (mAP)
The mean of Average Precision across all classes. For this model, we compute mAP for each class and average them.

Usage
Training:
Train the model with the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --epochs 10 --batch-size 8 --lr 0.005
Adjust hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, and the number of epochs based on your hardware and dataset.

Evaluation:
To evaluate the model after training:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py
This will output the IoU, Precision, Recall, and Average Precision on the validation or test set.
